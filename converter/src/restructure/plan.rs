//! The plan of the restructure: attributes and tabular sections of catalogs and documents.
//!
//! Input: the stored schema and names, and the staged image (`ConfigSave`) against the stored one
//! (`Config`). Output: the new `DBSchema` text, the new `DBNames`, the derived caches (`Params` `*.si`)
//! and the statements of the rebuild. Nothing here touches a database; `reader` fills the input, `exec`
//! runs the statements.
//!
//! What is checked, fail closed (anything else is refused with the reason):
//! 1. the staged image holds the same files as the stored one (no object added or removed) plus the
//!    `deleted` marker, which names removed attributes and nothing else;
//! 2. across every descriptor row of every kind, the new, the removed, the retyped and the re-indexed
//!    attributes all sit in catalogs or documents (a new attribute also in a tabular section of one); none
//!    changes its use; a retyped one is a variable string whose limit grows; a re-indexed one switches
//!    `DontIndex` <-> `Index` or `DontIndex` <-> `IndexWithAdditionalOrder`; the attributes of a tabular
//!    section only get new ones, and a new section stands after the ones the object has;
//! 3. each such object is otherwise unchanged as far as its table goes (its shape: hierarchy, code and
//!    description lengths, number length, ...; its tabular sections but for the new ones and the new
//!    attributes of the old ones) and it has no predefined data, no data history, no subordination;
//! 4. every stored attribute of it maps to the field the stored `DBSchema` entry has (the generator
//!    reproduces the stored entry before it is trusted to extend it);
//! 5. each new attribute has a supported type.
//!
//! Not checked (needs the decoders of the other kinds, that is the restructuring check's job): a changed
//! property of another object that changes its table (a register's dimension order, ...). Run this only on
//! an image the check has passed.
