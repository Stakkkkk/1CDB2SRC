//! Does a staged descriptor row differ from the stored one only by the
//! record format the staging platform writes?
//!
//! A native `config import` rewrites every descriptor it stages in the record
//! format of its own edition, whether the object changed or not: the version
//! number at the head of a record grows by one, a counted list gains the
//! default entries the new version introduced (and its counter grows by one),
//! a field the old version did not have appears with its default. The
//! metadata model reads a row by the fields it knows, so such a row decodes to
//! the same XML as the stored one although the bytes differ; a check that
//! trusted the decoding alone would call the row unchanged, and one that
//! trusted the bytes alone would call all 500 of them changes.
//!
//! This module settles it on the rows themselves. The two rows are read as
//! brace trees and aligned item by item; the rows are the same but for the
//! format when every difference is one of
//!
//! * the head of a list (its record version) is one greater;
//! * an integer inside a list, after its head, is one greater while an entry
//!   was inserted in that same list (a counter of the list);
//! * an entry the older version did not have was inserted, and it is one of
//!   the values [`FILLERS`] lists: nothing but the defaults the platform's
//!   importer was seen to write;
//! * an empty string holds the default of the new version ([`FILLS`]);
//! * in the row of the configuration, the extension compatibility mode
//!   names the edition of the platform that staged the row instead of the
//!   compatibility mode.
//!
//! Anything else is not proven, whichever way it decodes, and the caller
//! refuses the row with the first place that no rule explains
//! ([`Deviation`]). The tables are what one native import of the corpus
//! showed (`docs/apply/restructuring-check.md`, section 8.9): a row of
//! another shape is refused, never guessed.
