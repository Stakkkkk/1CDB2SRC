//! Stable identifiers of the rules and check steps that make a [`Reason`]
//! (see `model`).
//!
//! A reason used to carry its rule only as text inside `change`
//! (`9 -> 12 (a property no rule covers)`), so whoever had to act on a class
//! of reasons matched words. An id is the machine-readable form: it never
//! changes for a rule that keeps its meaning, and the text (`text`) is what
//! the reason's `change` still prints. `id()` is the string that goes into
//! the JSON report and into the tests' expectations.
//!
//! Two kinds of rules share the enumeration:
//! * the descriptor rules of `rules.rs`, which judge one change of an object
//!   (their `text` is the wording the reasons have always had);
//! * the steps of the check that judge something that is not a property
//!   (a row that cannot be read, a stage that lists a file it does not
//!   hold): their reasons carry a text of their own, `text` says what the
//!   step is.
